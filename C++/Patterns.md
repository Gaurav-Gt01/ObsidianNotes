# The four basic rules for printing any patterns : (Nested loops)
- The outer loop is for the number of rows present in the loop , ie the outer loop should run n times if n is the number of rows .
- The inner loop is for the number of columns in the loops , ie the inner loop should run for m times if m is the number of columns .
- Find a relation between number of rows and columns ie m and n .
- Find symmetry in the patterns .


# Tips :
- Always write down what all you have to print like space star space and then count how many times u have to print each thing and then find a logic to connect the number o rows and columns .
