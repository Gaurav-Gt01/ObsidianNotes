# 🧠 Obsidian Notes Vault

Welcome to my personal knowledge vault built using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)!  
This repository is a structured collection of everything I’ve learned and explored in the domains of programming, electronics, machine learning, and more.

> 📌 **Purpose**: To document, revise, and share technical concepts to everyone in a modular and interconnected way.
