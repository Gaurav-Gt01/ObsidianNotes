## 8. Push and Pull

- Push commits to GitHub:
```bash

git push origin main

```
main is the name of the brach we are pushing our commit to .


- To keep your repository  up to date with the changes made in the upstream branch we use the command :
```bash

git pull upstream <branch>

```

- This runs 2 commands :
```bash

git fetch upstream <branch>
```
This gets the latest changes from the main brach of the upstream repository .

``` bash
git merge upstream/<branch>

```
This merges those fetched changes to the < branch > of your repository .
