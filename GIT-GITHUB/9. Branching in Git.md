## 9. Branching in Git

- In git hub we have various branches and the default branch is called as the main / master branch . 
- Whenever we are making any changes in a big code base we should always create a separate branch on which we commit our changes . 
- This is done because if there are any errors in the commit made then the main brach is not affected .
- To create a brach we use the command :
```bash

git branch <new_branch_name>

```

- Switch to another branch:
```bash

git checkout <branch_name>

```

  - HEAD points to the current branch for new commits.

- To merge two branches 
```bash
git checkout main            # Switch to the target branch
git merge feature            # Merge the feature branch into main
```

- To delete a branch :
```bash
git branch -d feature        # Deletes the branch if it has been merged
```

Use -D instead of -d to force delete if it hasn't been merged .
