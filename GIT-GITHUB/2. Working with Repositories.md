## 2. Working with Repositories

- Clone a repository:
```bash

git clone <repository_url>

```

- Initialize a Git repository:
```bash

git init

```

This initailazes the folder to a git version control and any changes made in this are then recorded by the .git hidden folder .
This creates a hidden `.git` folder that starts tracking the directory.

- View hidden folders:
```bash

ls -a

```
