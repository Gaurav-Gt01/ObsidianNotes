## 7. Connecting to Remote Repository

- To connect your local repository on your device to a remote github repository we use the command :
```bash

git remote add origin <github_repo_url>

```
Here ,
remote - means connecting to a remote thing like a github repo 
add - means adding 
origin - it is the name of your own account (sometimes we use upstream in case of origin when we fork someones other repository )


- Verify the remote:
```bash

git remote -v

```

- The output will show the fetch and push URLs.
