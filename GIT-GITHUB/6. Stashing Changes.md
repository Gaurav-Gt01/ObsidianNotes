## 6. Stashing Changes

- Save changes temporarily in the backstage area .
- If i have made changes to a file and it is currently tracked  and now i want to work with a clean slate but i have this file in which i have made changes to then to work with a clean slate we use the command :
```bash

git stash

```


- To bring the files from the backstage area to the staging area we use the command :
```bash

git stash pop

```

- Clear all stashed changes or to clear the backstage area we use the command :
```bash

git stash clear

```
