## 4. Committing Changes

- Commit the staged changes:
```bash

git commit -m "your commit message"

```

This means that all the changes will be now saved in the history of the repository .
`-m` flag is used to add a message to the commit.


- View commit history:
```bash

git log

```

- Each commit is identified by a unique hash ID.
