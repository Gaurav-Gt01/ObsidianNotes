## 5. Resetting Commits

- Reset to a previous commit:
```bash

git reset <commit_hash>

```

- hash id is the big 20 digit alpha numeric thing that is written in front of the commit when we prompt git log .
- This removes commits made after that hash and moves the changes to the staging area.

- After resetting a pushed commit, force push is required as the commit is being shown on the git hub but not on my local system  .
- We cannot do this normally so we force push it .
```bash

git push origin <branch> -f

```
