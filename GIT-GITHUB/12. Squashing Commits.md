## 12. Squashing Commits

- To merge selected commits in a single commit we use the command :
```bash

git rebase -i <commit_hash_above_target>
```
- In the interactive list:
- Use `pick` to keep the commit.
- Use `squash` to merge the commit with the pick one above.
- Exit interactive mode using `:x`.
- Edit and save the final commit message.
