## 10. Working with Forks and Upstream

- When you have forked someone others git hub repository and have it cloned and you want to add from where it is forked it is called as the upstream url . 
- So similar to adding / connecting your local repository to the remote repository you can do this by using the command :
```bash

git remote add upstream <original_repo_url>

```

- Pull updates from upstream:
```bash

git pull upstream <branch>

```
