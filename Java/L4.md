(loops for loop , while loop , do while loop)

- ## For Loop :
Its the same as the C++ for loop 

``` 
for(intitizization ; condition ; update the initialized variable){

// whatever u want in the loop 

}
```

- __Scope : It means that a given variable can be only be used in the block it is declared and initialised . For example if a variable is declared in a certain loop it cannot be printed beyond that loop and a error will be encountered .

- ## While Loop :
	- Most basic loop which runs until the condition is true .
	- Here the declaration is out if the loop and the update if the condition is n the loop itself .
	- This loop is used when we dont know how many times loop should run .


```
int a = 5 ;

// while loop :
while(a<10){
sout("Hello World") ;
a++ ;
}

// the output if the code will be that Hello World will be printed 5 times .
```

- ## Do While Loop :
This loops runs atleast one , even if the condition is not satisfied its goes through the body once .

```
do{

//body 

}while(condition)
```

- ## BREAK STATMENT :
	- This is used to get out of the loop .

- ## CONTINUE STATMENT :
	- This is used to SKIP the next iteration . It is differenet than the break statment because in break it gets us out of the loop but here it just skips the iteration .
	
- ## LABELLED LOOP :
	- In this the loop is labelled and it is used so that the break and continue statment can understand which loop to break or continue .
	- This is generally used in nested loops .
```
label_name :
	   for(int i=0 , i<5 , i++){
	   //body of the loop
	   }
	   //here the for loop is named label_name 
```
