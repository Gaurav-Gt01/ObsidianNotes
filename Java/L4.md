(loops for loop , while loop , do while loop)

- ## For Loop :
Its the same as the C++ for loop 

``` 
for(intitizization ; condition ; update the initialized variable){

// whatever u want in the loop 

}
```

- __Scope : It means that a given variable can be only be used in the block it is declared and initialised . For example if a variable is declared in a certain loop it cannot be printed beyond that loop and a error will be encountered .

- ## While Loop :
Most basic loop which runs until the condition is true . Here the declaration is out if the loop and the update if the condition is n the loop itself .

```
int a = 5 ;

// while loop :
while(a<10){
sout("Hello World") ;
a++ ;
}

// the output if the code will be that Hello World will be printed 5 times .
```
