There are objects and methods in a class . 

Objects are the objects plus the variables in java .
Methods means the functions . 

**Now to access a method or a object of a class u have to create a object .**

Then using dot operator u can access a class using its object . 

## TO CREATE NEW OBJECT OF A CLASS :

ClassName ObjectName = new ClassName 
Ex.
```
	class DemoClass ; // creates a new class DemoClass 

	DemoClass demoClass = new DemoClass ; // creates a new object         called demo class 
	
```
- Class name always follows convention like DemoClass , ClassOne etc .
- Object name also follows convention like demoClass , classOne , dc , co etc . 

## NOTE:  
- String is a class data type as well as an  primitive data type . 
- Class names always starts with capital letters .
- There are 8 primitive data types and class data types .
