(If else , switch case and ternary operator)


#  IF - ELSE  STATMENTS :

```
if(condition){
  action to be exectued if
} else{
   else action to be exectued 
}
```

### If curly braces are not used then only the first line after if / else block will be executed  
# SWITCH CASE STATMENTS :

```
switch (condition){
case 1:
break ;
case 2:
break ;
}
```

Now for example if u want 2 cases to have same function then u can write both of them together in one block . 
For example : 
```
case 1 : case 2
``` 

# TERNARY OPERATOR :

- It simplifies the if else statments 
- Used only when something is returned as a value .

```
condition ? expression 1 : expression 2 ;

// If conditon is true then expression1 is executed otherwise expression 2 is executed .
```

Example :
```
int a = 10 ;
int b = 20 ;

int max = a > b ? a : b ;
sout("Value of max is "+max ) ;

Output : Value of max is 20 ;
```
