(operators and user input)

# __OPERATORS :

## ARITHMATIC OPERATORS 

- Basic operators like +, - , * ,  /   and  %  ie the modulo operator .
- In / operator it gives out the result in decimals only if the values to be divided are
  float or double and the variable printing the values out is also a similar data type or u have to typecast any one of the number explicitly .

## ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR 

- These are operators like = , +=  , -= , * =  , /= , %= .
- For example 
```
int a = 10 ; 
int b = 5 ;
a += b ;  // this is a = a +b 
system.out.println("a")

output = 5 
```

Similarly , a -= b means a = a - b and so on .

## RELATIONAL OPERATOR :

- These are basic operators like == , != , < , > , <= , >= . 
- These always return boolean value ie true or false . 

## LOGICAL OPERATOR :

- These are operators like && (and operator) , || (or operator) and ! (not operator) . 
- These are similar to the and or not gate .

## BITWISE OPERATOR :


## INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATOR :

- These are operators like a++ or a-- .
- a++ = a +1    and     a-- is a = a-1  .

# __USER INPUT :

- To take input from a user create a object of scanner  :

```
import java.util.Scanner;
//import this library to use scanner function 
```

```
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in) ;   
//creating the object named sc to taking user input 

int age = sc.nextInt() ;   // u can change the data type as U like

System.print.out("The age is "+age) ;

```

- # VERY IMPORTANT NOTE : nextLine input is used when the code is required to be scanned till the end of the line . Next input is used when code is to be scanned only until a space is hit . so when we use next input then it scans only till a space and not till the end of the line . 

- After using this programme make sure to close it otherwise the memory will be occupied . 
```
sc.close() ;
```
